Hello guys
 
In this Database we learn how to write queries & how to queries works in any database.

By using these data we maked a School,College and University management system
I include students,teachers,subject,classes,attendence,parents etc..
In this I used Keys(primary,forgin).

After this database we make also front-end for using this database as normal user.
For front-end we use Html,Css,Javascript & for making connection between Front-end and Database we use (PHP)

Purpose of this project:

To learn how the queries work.
How we make views.
How to make joins between tables.
How to apply Key between tables.
How to insert/delete/update/ data into a table.
I also share GUI diagram of this Database for better understanding.

Benifits of this Database:

Every normal user/Student can easily  understand and apply it.
I explain all these thing in the (university_management.sql) file.
